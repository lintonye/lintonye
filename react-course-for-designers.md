## Why React?
Have you heard of Airbnb's new tool [React Sketch.app](http://airbnb.design/painting-with-code/)? Have you ever wondered how your developer implemented that nifty animation you created with After Effects (Hint: [Lottie](http://airbnb.design/lottie/)? Do you know what assets you should give the developer for that new app written in React Native? Have you ever hoped that you can tweak the styles in the [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) your developer created?

React has a lot to offer. It spreads like a wild fire. It is super relevant to every UI designer. In fact I think it's too risky not to know anything about this React thing that your developer friends passionately talk about everyday.

## I'm a designer, why should I learn coding?
I always believe that learning to code will help a designer become better at design. Armed with a better understanding of how things work, you will find the communication with developers much more efficient. Your design ideas would be more convincing and more respected. You can even [design with code](https://blog.framer.com/what-if-a-designer-learns-code-59d790024c9e).

New skills you learn will open new doors. Trust me, it will be a new world of creativity!

Check out this [post](http://www.reactnativediary.com/2017/05/09/react-for-designers-interviews.html) if you want to hear other designers' opinions about the same question.

## But is this about ReactJS or React Native?
There might be some confusion about the differences between the two. The good news is that they are both called "React" for a reason. Once you learn the fundamental concepts, it will be straightforward to use it for the web (ReactJS), mobile (React Native), Sketch (React Sketch.app), or ReactXYZ. BTW: it seems Facebook has [never officially used](https://web.archive.org/web/20130529213355/https://facebook.github.io/react/) the name "ReactJS" or "React.js" for the web part.

At least in the beginning, I will focus on teaching React fundamentals with minimal setup requirements. Afterwards, I'll consider to branch into web, mobile or other platforms depending on the demand.

What do you think? [Email me](mailto:linton@jimulabs.com) if you have any suggestions!

## So where can I download/sign up for the course?
It's still at a very early stage. I plan to gradually develop the course content over a few months. So you are practically witnessing the birth of a brand new course! It's a good opportunity to have your influence on creating a great resource for the entire design community. [Shoot me an email](mailto:linton@jimulabs.com), I'm all ears!

Also, leave your email address above and I'll keep you posted when I have something worth sharing.

## What should I know before taking this course?
I assume most designers know about HTML and CSS, and some exposure of JavaScript. Hopefully we can use that as a starting point.

But again, I'm still exploring. Perhaps that'd be enough, perhaps not. Perhaps I'd consider to add a module teaching basic programming. I don't know yet. It'll depend on what you want and my availability. So let me know what you think!

## What will be taught?
I've got some initial ideas [here](https://trello.com/b/E7lYUXqZ/react-for-designers), but let me know what you think!

## Who will teach the course?
Me for now. I'm a developer and I'm learning design as well. I've been working on mobile since 2007 and React Native since 2015. I've created a [course](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/animations-and-transitions) on Android animation at Treehouse, and a course on Material Design with React Native on Lynda (in production). I also contribute to [React Navigation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation) project.

Thanks a lot for your interest!

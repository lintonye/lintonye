- **Understand the constraints of React, design accordingly**
- **Tweak the styles yourself instead of waiting for developers' spare cycle**
- **Hand off assets that your developers love**
- **Empower your design with code -- be able to push back when you're told it can't be done**
- **Bring your design to life with your own hands!**

[//]: - Stop waiting for developers to implement your work
[//]: - Be able to push back when you’re told it can’t be done
[//]: - Talk in their jargon with developers

## What will be in the course?
The general goal of this course is to give you a firm understanding of the fundamentals, capability and limitations of React and **how they relate to design**. I think the most effective way to achieve this goal is to actually build something with React -- with hands-on experience in implementing modern, realistic user interfaces, you'll be able to understand developers' jargon a lot more deeply, compared to, for example, reading about those terms in an article, or over a lunch-and-learn session.

Some tentative topics include:

- Fundamentals
  - React fundamentals
  - UI fundamentals: Layout, styling etc.
- Build realistic prototypes (mobile apps)
  - Animations and transitions
  - Popular components
  - [React Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook)
- Build realistic prototypes (web)
- Design with code
  - Airbnb's [React Sketch.app](http://airbnb.design/painting-with-code/)

For more information, check out [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/E7lYUXqZ/react-for-designers) where you can vote on ideas. I'd really appreciate your feedback!

## But I'm a designer, why should I learn coding?
I encourage you to check out this [post](/2017/05/09/react-for-designers-interviews.html) to hear other designers' opinions about the same question.

Learning to code will help you become better at design. Armed with a better understanding of how things work, you will find the communication with developers much more efficient. Your design ideas would be more convincing and more respected. You can even [design with code](https://blog.framer.com/what-if-a-designer-learns-code-59d790024c9e).

New skills you learn will open new doors. Trust me, it will be a new world of creativity!


## Is this about ReactJS or React Native?
There might be some confusion about the differences between the two. The good news is that they are both called "React" for a reason. Once you learn the fundamental concepts, it will be straightforward to use it for the web (ReactJS), mobile (React Native), Sketch (React Sketch.app), or ReactXYZ. BTW: it seems Facebook has [never officially used](https://web.archive.org/web/20130529213355/https://facebook.github.io/react/) the name "ReactJS" or "React.js" for the web part. It's just "React".

At least at the beginning, I will focus on teaching React fundamentals with minimal setup requirements. Afterwards, I'll consider to branch into web, mobile or other platforms depending on the demand.

What do you think? [Email me](mailto:linton@jimulabs.com) if you have any suggestions!

## So where can I download / sign up for the course?
It's still at a very early stage. I plan to gradually develop the course content over a few months. So you are practically witnessing the birth of a brand new course! It's a good opportunity to have your influence on creating a great resource for the entire design community. [Shoot me an email](mailto:linton@jimulabs.com), I'm all ears!

Also, leave your email address above and I'll keep you posted when I have something worth sharing.

## What should I know before taking this course?
I assume most designers know about HTML and CSS, with some exposure of JavaScript. Hopefully we can use that as a starting point.

But again, I'm still exploring. Perhaps that'd be enough, perhaps not. Perhaps I'd consider to add a module teaching JavaScript basics. I don't know yet. It'll depend on what you want and my availability. So let me know what you think!

## Who will teach the course?
Me for now. I'm a developer and I'm learning design as well. I've been working on mobile since 2007 and React Native since 2015. I've authored a [course](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/animations-and-transitions) about Android animation at Treehouse, and a course on Material Design with React Native on Lynda (in production). I also contribute to [React Navigation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation) project.

Thanks a lot for your interest!

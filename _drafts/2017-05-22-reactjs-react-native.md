React receives a lot of interest not only among developers, but also designers. [Many designers](TODO DN post) are considering to include React into their toolbox. People talk about React, ReactJS, React.js, React Native, Airbnb's [React Sketch.app](TODO) etc. But to my surprise, a lot of people do not really understand the precise difference between those terms (to be honest, myself included, before writing this post).

This post is an attempt to explain the terms in React family in plain English. After reading, hopefully you'll understand a bit more about what React is and the relationship and difference between ReactXYZ.


- React as a paradigm, a way of thinking
- RN: batteries included
- RJS: must set up the project; though there is Create React App
- RN vs mobile pages
- Native app vs web app
  - perhaps include a video showing the different performance
- React Sketch.app
- To make it even more complicated:
  - react-native-web: https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web
  - https://github.com/Microsoft/reactxp

- layout:
  - RN: flexbox
  - RJ: CSS
- Animations:
  - RN: no CSS Animations

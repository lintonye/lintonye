React receives a lot of interest not only among developers, but also designers. [Many designers are considering](TODO DN post) to include React into their toolbox. People talk about React, ReactJS, React.js, React Native, [React Sketch.app](TODO) etc. But to my surprise, a lot of them are not aware of the precise difference between those terms.

This post is an attempt to explain the terms in React family in plain English. After reading this, hopefully you'll understand a bit more about what React is and the relationship and difference between ReactXYZ.


- React as a paradigm, a way of thinking
- RN: batteries included
- RJS: must set up the project; though there is Create React App
- RN vs mobile pages
- Native app vs web app
  - perhaps include a video showing the different performance
- React Sketch.app
- To make it even more complicated:
  - react-native-web: https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web
  - https://github.com/Microsoft/reactxp

- layout:
  - RN: flexbox
  - RJ: CSS
- Animations:
  - RN: no CSS Animations

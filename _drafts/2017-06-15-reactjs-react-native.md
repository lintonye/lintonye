# ReactJS, React Native, ReactXYZ...
Hopefully you've got a hang of what React is, right? But what are those other things, such as ReactJS, React.js, React Native? Let's take a look.

Initially, React was created to build web applications. It's only about portraits from the studio "Web Browser".

As time goes by, people realized that React is actually capable of working with other studios, such as studio "Mobile", studio "Mac" and studio "Sketch".

To make things more efficient, React hires an assistant "ReactDOM" whose only job is to talk to Domo in the studio "Web Browser". React can now focus on receiving sketches from the customers (developers) and making clay models (virtual DOM).

When customers ask for portraits from other studios, React hires more assistants, which are collectively called "Renderers". "ReactDOM" is a Renderer too.

![Perhaps three images: React uses assistants to talk to models in three different studios: Domo, the model in studio "Mobile" and the model in studio "Sketch"](TODO)

This is how React Native was born. The original React for the web (let's call it "React Web") was split into two parts: ReactJS and ReactDOM.

With ReactJS at its core, plus a few new renderers, plus native APIs such as the network, accelerometer and storage, React Native is formed as a complete platform for building native apps. Using the same ideas of reactive UI, virtual DOM and components, we can build native mobile apps, desktop apps or even convert code into images in Sketch.

![React Native = ReactJS + renderers + other stuff](TODO)

React Native includes all you need to build an app, whereas React Web is just a small library focuses specifically on the UI in a web browser. This is the major difference between the two.

Due to historical reasons, many people use ReactJS or React.js to refer to React Web. Interestingly, it seems Facebook has never officially used the name "ReactJS" or "React.js". It [has always been just "React"](https://web.archive.org/web/20130529213355/https://facebook.github.io/react/).

# TODO what React Web is for? What React Native is for?
